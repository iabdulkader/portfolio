        As an experienced and passionate full stack developer, I bring a diverse
        range of technical expertise to the table. From building responsive user
        interfaces with React, Next.js, and Svelte to designing scalable backend
        systems with Express, Node, Python, Django, and Docker, I am comfortable
        with a range of different technologies. With excellent communication
        skills and a collaborative mindset, I thrive in team-oriented
        environments and always aim to add value to any project I am a part of.
